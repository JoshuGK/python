0,Khansa farooqui,"Never in my life I waited for a phone this bad and happy to say the wait was worth it. My LG started giving me issues just after a few months and the Samsung before that had 3 display issues in about 15 months. Tired of splurging on flagship Androids, I started looking for alternatives - the cheaper kinds, the more value for money kindsOnePlus has a pretty loyal band of followers but I never appreciated the Chinese-ness of it but boy, the device is as premium as it can get. OnePlus 6 as I understood from my friends was a great device and OnePlus 6T ought to be better, right? Well, it is, objectively.Call quality: Isn't that the primary purpose of any phone. Much better than the LG which was as good as unusable and slightly topping the SamsungsSpeaker: Reasonably loud to be useful but don't expect it to win sound quality awards. My LG with DAC stands defeated when I use it with my earphones and headphones. My Beyerdynamic cans are useless though as somehow connecting it results in ghost clicksDisplay: Amazing, if you know what AMOLED is you'd know the bright contrast-y nature of the display with equally amazing blacks.. and better power management. For the first time ever, started watching movies on mobilesProcessor, RAM and graphics: Snappy and does make you feel you are holding a fast, latest, flagship device. Should hold good for probably 2 yearsBuild quality: Very unchinesy (for want of a better word). Edges feel strong yet beautifully carved, sides are solid and buttons are tactile yet feel built to last. The package comes with a case and I am using a case. Another personal first! Oh, the package was thoughtful like none other. Almost feels like a personalized gift boxBattery: Pretty darn good. I was 98% at 2200 hours, used for 3-4 hours non-stop in the night and it still took me thru to 1700 hours the other day with medium to heavy usage. I just recently let battery go under 5% and feel it's discharging faster now (could only be psychological). Don't let battery go too low though in most likelihood it doesn't do anything as the phone shuts down before it reaches true 0Camera: I bet this is what people are interested in most - the reason why it's last here! The hardware is not much different from the OP6 but in a blind camera test, the T took slightly better low light images with the 6 blowing off highlights more. It could be an issue with that one device but suffice to say the camera is awesome and very capable unless you go comparing with the Pixel 3. I was literally blown from the result of clicking a really, really dark scene and it still had magically squeezed in almost natural light in the picture - just don't expect to create a 10x10 photo frame and you'll be fine. In regular night scenes with some ambient light, there isn't much difference between Auto and night mode. Photography under normal light condition is good - adequately sharp, not overtly saturated and we'll detailed. I find the white balance slightly off but can be fixed in ""pro"" settings. At times, the highlight gets blown out but that's okay for a phone at this price point and I believe many of the camera shortcomings can be fixed with a software upgrade. I would have preferred a wide-angle camera over the depth camera - mind you, the depth camera too works brilliantly in portrait mode and gives you a more natural bokeh effect than software enhanced background blurAll in all, I am quite satisfied with the purchase and probably gonna stick with OnePlus having experimented with most Android manufacturers. Highly recommended!"
1,Vijay,"Pros:Superb battery life...streches to 7hrs of screen on time..on heavy usage 5.5 to 6 hrs screen on time.Camera quality...well lets just say its good but for the price range,its mediocore...but most of us wont even notice the difference. Though the slow motion is cool but its of zero use at night.Built quality....extremely good and feels premium to hold.I went fir tge mirror back edition,though what they say is true,it is a smudge magnet.but still tuck it in a tpu clearcase and it it looks awesome.Sound quality...its one of the best i used till date..its so loud that that my room mates have grown to hate it :Dcoming to the display...well it okay sort...my previous op3t had a better display than this...*on comparing op6,op6t and op3t hands on..i'd op3t was the best followed by op6 and then op6t! The coloyrs are much vibrant on the previous two even when kept on same settings(default screen calibration).It takes exact 1hr and 27 mins to charge from 0 to 100...same as op6...despite having a bigger battery.Ummm what else....Yeah...the finger print sensor...i know its slow as comoared to the traditional finger print sensor...but God its so cool..the difference is notocable for people coming from one plus line.But the lag of 0.20s is acceptable...with the contant ota ipdates the fingerprint sensor has seem to gather up speed and seems to open much faster..Its open 8 out of 10 times i try..but with face unlock on..you wont even notice the delay of 0.20s...But belive me...it is fast...damn fast as comoared to the other phones out in the market...tested it against vivo v11 pro.. verdict: op6t blows it out of the park.Oxygen Os...has gone to a whole different level with gestures 2.0. add 8gb of ram and a snapdragon 845...you just glide from one app to the other...buttery smooth...they werent lying when they cam up with the advertisement for op6t!!!Cons:The nightscape mode is more of like a hit and miss thing...at lowest it will give you an image with 0 enhancement...but whennit does it job,it produces fairly good images..but at the cost of sharpness.Headphone jack....well i miss it..i often hate the fact that i need to unplug the charger  to listen to music or watch a video at the end of the day.The weight is noticable...my op3t was about 155gms...op6t is now 185gms...so i constantly realise when i pick up the phone...dang this is heavy!!!It is a tad bit narrower than op6 about 0.5mm and with the screen size being so large..its seems like a long glowing rod at night!Also since the screens are rounded at the corners there is loss in pixel and video content...you will notice it much clearly while playing pubg...afterall the game has more buttons than a nascar car!If you have any questions,do ask!"
2,Anuraag Das,"Pros:+Zero lag , great battery 5*+camera is superb as similar to previous version, though has some soft upgrades. 5*+Dash Charging is super cool. 5*+Display is the best you can get for this price range! 4*+S845 is undoubtedly powerful and apps load and work seamlessly 5*+Great gaming experience ( with not much of heating issue & battery drain) 5*+Great sound quality (5*)Cons:-Indisplay fingerprint scanner seems not a very useful thing. Its difficult to use it (better go with face unlock). It will be much better only if you add all 10 fingers :-) 3*-Fingerprint scanning is comparatively slow (lot of catchy graphics) and sometimes delayed if a wrong finger was used. 2*-Using without a cover is too risky - the back cover is very slippery . But using a cover the phone looses its identity though.-No AUX port, though a type-C to AUX cable is provided with the pack, carrying it all the time is difficult .overall, its a very nice phone and I'm just getting used to it. So far so good.--UPDATE--I have used the phone for almost 20 days now, here are some more insights on the device---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I got the Type-C bullet headphones after 15 days, but I'm just disappointed because it does not have the class. Its like a cheap headphone you can get for ~300-400 (I got it free, so can't complain though)-I face frequent difficulties in connecting to the Car bluetooth Audio (I use SYNC on FORD).-Battery life and Charging is very good.-Crashed 2 times (seems to be a kernel panic) and rebooted while listening to music with full volume (not sure of  reason)-Gaming experience is one of the best. Never had a glitch.-Low light face detection is not good.-Camera is better if you install Google Camera ( OnePlus camera is not bad)"
3,Kris,"Amazon Delivery is excellent as always. Got it delivered within a day, that too, to my native city(Non Metro, not Bangalore).Coming to phone itself, had ordered Mirror Black 8/128 GB variant.Pros:1. Excellent build quality2. Great fluid smooth Oxygen OS3. Display is gorgeous. Feels bit longer and tad narrower than OnePlus 6's screen. (Tech spec also says so.)4. Felt sound quality over earphones (JBL E1+) is great... Compared to my previous OnePlus2. Felt comparatively better than OnePlus6. Though I don't have any test result to show, I just heard sound effects of same song on both OnePlus6 and 6T, Base and clarity of music on OnePlus 6T just felt refined if not same.5. Camera. Just awesome. Nightscape is good in low light. Very snappy camera. They r soft features which r coming to OnePlus 6 anyway.6. In Display fingerprint, well it's a good tech. Works well most of the time,even though not as fast as physical sensor. Did a false unlock with non registered finger when I was testing üòä. It happened just once. Bleeds bright light from the sensor area while unlocking,(well that's how it's technology work)which might be annoying during night with sleepy eyesüòê. Face unlock works like a charm.Its even faster than Screen Unlock. Only downside is Face unlock is image based.hence require sufficient light on face to recognize you. Also, you need to turn on screen to unlock, unlike IR based sensor in iPhone X or Huawei Mate 20.7. PUBG game looks gorgeous with HDR and Ultra frame rate settings. No lag or stuttering whatsoever. Game runs fast n smooth with great graphics.Cons: (not many)1. In display fingerprint sensor even though worlds fastest among In Display sensors in terms of unlocking speed, need more polishing. Not as fast as physical. But u will not know much difference if u r coming from OnePlus2. Unlocking bleeds bright light on sensor area might be annoying at night.2. No Headphone jack might be deal breaker for some. But they give type c to 3.5mm adapter in box. So shud not be as much as deal breaker. Pre-Order will fetch u a type c headphones for free.3. Nothing else which I can think of now."
4,Sharath Ulloor,"DESIGN:If you thinking that OnePlus 6 and 6T has no major difference than you are absolutely wrong and highly mistaken if you thing 6 is better than 6T. Price hike is completely justified.Visible differences between 6 & 6T:Higher screen to body ratio, Gorilla Glass 6, in-display fingerprint scanner, taller, water-drop notch. 3700mAh battery.Technical advancement:Advance AI which smartly uses your RAM and ROM which actually boosts the performance, Better heat-sink than 6.CAMERA:I took my canon 1300D with two lens; portrait and 18-55 and OnePlus6T for comparison test. OnePlus 6T provided better results when both on Auto-mode. It has amazing contrast, perfect saturation; but the thing where it stood-out from others its it night picture quality. It does wonders even if there is almost no light and that is some magic over there. Front camera absolutely stunning and comes with screen flash for low light selfies.BATTERY:Battery charging- 0 to 65% in 30 mins and at 45 min it reaches 86%. Full charge by 1hr8 mins when internet, Bluetooth and wifi off. On heavy use it survives 8 hrs (I watched 2 movies in HD with 50% screen brightness and 1 hour PubG gaming on HD, 1 hour YouTubing). On average usage, 17 hours very smoothly(casual social media surfing, browsing, camera usage about 5 to 6 pictures using flash). Without internet usage at all and battery saver on, it can go whooping 3 DAYS !SPEAKERS:External speakers are loud, I mean really very loud. Hearing speaker is very cool by its looks and loud too. Volume rockers and power switch is perfectly hard.SECURITY:Though I feel face detection is worst type of security because it has many drawbacks, its quick. And finger print scanner is also faster than its competitors. The part which irritates is that while using at night in dark, for face and fingerprint detection, the display gets 100% to scan which is very annoying and very uneasy for eyes."
5,Amazon Customer,"Life is short ,don't waste it in reading reviews ... If you have the budgetBUY THIS PHONE !!But since you have decided to read further ... Let's tell you more ...After days of research.After hours Gyaan from my gyaani frnz n geeksI finally settled on Never Settle.Constantly using this since last 48 hours. I am highlighting specific features over OP6.Pros :Speed : More than your expectations , u will not be disappointed even throwing maximum high RAM using apps , its RAM management is over the mark.Battery:Lasted on heavy usage for approx 7-8 hours.Fingerprint Scanner:Initially it required more firm pressure , but after 10-15 (at max) unlocks you just have to feather touch it. I have enrolled both thumbs and it works pretty smooth and blaze fast , I'm not using face unlock to test scanner more.)Oxygen OS : Makkhan hai ;)Display: Lit and bright even in broad daylight.Type C over 3.5 mm -Folks I would like to say we are reluctant to adapt this as we are so used to our traditional methods but remember it's technology and we should appreciate the change and upgrade our gadgets accordingly, which ofcourse is a dent to your pocket. Cutting it short I'm still using my apple 3.5mm earphones via the supplied connector and the quality is not compromised neither in the headphones or aux input to your multimedia systems, its loud and crystal clear.Cons:Camera is same as one plus 6Not so impressed with the night mode as its digitally optimising the continuous frames which blurs any moving object but the steady subject is quite clear ...Overall it has the same camera performance as one plus 6 . Which is awesome.End Note :Do the maths ;)Don't forget to put science, technology, innovation and a garnish of elegant design.If you have the budget (or likely to make a jugaad from friends n family :D ) own this ... I bet this bae won't disappoint you .N if you're a one plus 6 user.Wait for one plus 7 .For Amazon and Green MobilesFolks I would like to appreciate the fast secure and timely delivery of my prepaid package with all due precautions and using the tamper proof package.This no doubt increased my trust over online purchase of high value items prepaid.Thank You !!Reviewed On 6T ;)"
6,Ash,"I have recently bought OnePlus6T and have been using the phone from past few days. Here is my feedback on the phone:Pros:i. Android Pie is smooth in its functionality. The upgrades are definitely adding further improvement to the UI.ii. Camera is the best you can find in any phone. Low light photography is amazing. Front portrait pics are clean and decent. The quality of the photos are incredible and unbeatable with any other phone of the same price range.iii. Battery backup is unbelievable. One time full charge is approximately carrying for 9 hours which includes heavy gaming like PUBG.iv. Snapdragon processor is very fast. Under heavy graphics  HD mode, PUBG is smooth in its gameplay with hardly any lag.v. Dual sim VOLTE support is yet another added advantage with smart wifi switching option.vi. Sound is very high and crystal clear. The speaker is very powerful and mic is also very sensitive.Cons:i. The edges of the phone which are having place for menu, back button are little difficult to access with the case cover (Minimal problem but can be adjusted with)ii. Slight lag in the indisplay finger print sensor (taking little longer than expected) yet fast enough not to lag your work.iii. Ambient display brightness is sometimes unable to adjust in sunlight which may be stressful to the eyesOverall verdict is that the phone is a true definition for a flagship killer.NOTE: I was using Oneplus 3 earlier and my pros and cons are based on the comparision of my previous experiences"
7,Ash,"VerdictThe OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.ProsNew fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edgeUp-to-date, versatile OSFast Charge is still greatSleek, premium designGreat performanceGreat battery lifeConsCamera's Nightscape mode needs workAnother headphone jack bites the dustFingerprint sensor needs refinementPoor audio capabilitieshis affordable Android flagship sports a lightning-fast in-display fingerprint sensor and powerful performance for half the price of its rivals.Super-fast in-display fingerprint sensorGorgeous display with tiny teardrop notchImproved camera supportAndroid Pie out of the box.AGAINSTNo headphone jackLacks wireless chargingCamera: Improved, but not amazingOnePlus didn't make any tweaks to the camera hardware in the 6T. Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.Unfortunately, that exposure doesn't do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn't much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost's eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3's shot. This is without the Pixel 3's forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device's low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR‚Äôs shot is more true-to-life ‚Äî the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there's not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3's result.Performance: Flagship speed for lessThe 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone's 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google's Pixel 3 XL (4GB).Battery LifeThe OnePlus 6T‚Äôs 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6's 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XRThe OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple's most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display ‚Äî the 6T's 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR's 6.1-inch screen.For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to KnowThe 6T is the first flagship phone released in the U.S. with an in-display fingerprint sensor. Spoiler alert: The sensor's lightning fast and amazing.T-Mobile customers can buy the 6T in-store, and it also supports Verizon's network.Farewell, headphone jack. OnePlus has parted ways with the 3.5mm port. A USB-C dongle is included in the box.Android 9.0 Pie with OyxgenOS doesn't feel bloated.New Night photography feature aims to improve low-light shots, but the Pixel 3 is better.A recently-released McLaren Edition offers 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus' new Warp Charge system.Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notchOnePlus isn't pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it's true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.Display: Still stunningThe OnePlus 6T‚Äôs display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6's screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don't.AGAINST'Only' full HD resolutionNo microSD card slot"

9,Arun kumar T.A,"Design--The back is a swathe of curved glass 3D glass that sits comfortably against your palm. At launch the two colours: Midnight Black and Mirror Black, sport two distinctly different finishes. In my opinion, the Midnight Black model I tested is the better looking of the two, with a distinctive S-shaped reflection appearing across its back when the light hits it that has an almost opalescent quality.Screen--The 6T packs the biggest display OnePlus has ever put on a phone. At 6.41-inches it‚Äôs sure to satisfy media-lovers, mobile photographers and gamers.6T supports the full DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and the company‚Äôs thrown in options for a variety other colour spaces too, such as sRGB, as well as a warm night and monochrome reading mode feature. The use of an AMOLED panel is appreciated too, ensuring great contrast and deep blacks, which again helps when enjoying video.Performance--The ‚ÄòT‚Äô series phones, like Google‚Äôs Pixel phones, come at an awkward time if you‚Äôre after the latest and greatest mobile processor on the market. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset at the heart of the OnePlus 6T is an undeniable powerhouse, that‚Äôs featured in nearly every 2018 flagship Android phone but it‚Äôs about to be supplanted.Software(OOS)--OnePlus was among a handful of manufacturers that promised to deliver fast Android updates and with the OnePlus 6, it certainly delivered. The OnePlus 6T runs an enhanced version of that same Android 9.0 Pie experience out the box with OnePlus‚Äô OxygenOS overlay on top.There‚Äôs little more I can say that I want from OnePlus‚Äô take on Android here. I‚Äôd like a one-handed mode that actually shrinks the entire UI but I think I‚Äôm in the minority there, and I‚Äôm curious to try out the promised fingerprint-sensor based shortcuts feature but beyond that, perhaps a few fewer of OnePlus‚Äô own apps stepping on Google‚Äôs toes wouldn‚Äôt hurt.Camera--The camera hardware at play here appears to be identical to that of its predecessor, with a dual 16/20-megapixel snapper taking point, rocking a respectably wide f/1.7 aperture and PDAF (phase detection autofocus), along with OIS (optical image stabilisation) and enlarged 1.22¬µm pixels on that main 16-megapixel sensor. There‚Äôs also a 16-megapixel front-facer which leverages EIS (electronic image stabilisation). It‚Äôs a promising hardware setup.Battery Life--The OnePlus 6T‚Äôs 3700mAh power pack is a winner based on my experiences.With 13 hours away from the wall plug and four hours of screen-on time, my OnePlus 6T finished the day at an even 50% charge. In that time I streamed 30 minutes of Netflix, which sapped 6% of the charge (with the screen brightness at half), while a 30 minute stretch of PUBG Mobile, running through multiple short, sharp arcade matches, took 8% out of the battery.Fast Charge (formerly Dash Charge) is a big reason to buy a OnePlus. It‚Äôs been the best fast-charging standard out there for a while (although that‚Äôs starting to change) and the company has distilled the premise with simple elegance into the tagline, ‚Äúa day‚Äôs power in half an hour‚Äù.Pros:New fingerprint sensor feels cutting-edgeUp-to-date, versatile OSDash Charge is still great and better than OnePlus 6Sleek, premium designGreat performanceGreat CameraGreat battery lifeCons:Camera's Nightscape mode(Focus) needs workAnother headphone jack bites the dustFingerprint sensor needs refinementNo LED notification lightNo more colour optionsPUBG Settings:Graphics- Upto HDRFrame Rate- upto UltraVerdict:The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table but still needs some tweaking.If you find this review as helpful then please click the helpful button.Thanks to all."
